# AGENTS

This repository includes guidance for automated coding agents.

## Start here

Read `GEMINI.md` for the detailed project context (overview, setup, conventions, and TODOs).

## Code Quality & SOLID Principles

Refer to `TODO.md` for comprehensive guidelines on SOLID principles, clean code improvements, and refactoring priorities. This document outlines:
- Current violations of SOLID principles
- Priority improvements with migration plan
- Specific code changes needed
- Success metrics for refactoring

## When collaborating in this repo

- Prefer small, focused changes aligned with `TODO.md` priorities
- After code changes, run:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm build`
- Keep documentation links pointing to `AGENTS.md` as the entry point (it links to `GEMINI.md`)
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices outlined in `TODO.md`
