# AGENTS

This repository includes guidance for automated coding agents.

## Start here

Read `GEMINI.md` for the detailed project context (overview, setup, conventions, and TODOs).

## When collaborating in this repo

- Prefer small, focused changes.
- After code changes, run:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm build`
- Keep documentation links pointing to `AGENTS.md` as the entry point (it links to `GEMINI.md`).
